# RandomScripts
An incomplete bunch of scripts I wrote over the years to ease my tasks.

I know. Not very intuitive. But they work like they should. And "[wifitest](https://github.com/C0d3rZ3r0/RandomScripts/blob/master/WindowsBatch/wifitest.bat)" is a misnomer because it doesn't really test the wifi, just the internet connection. I did wifitest.bat because the DOS/Windows ping command implemntation didn't have an audible ping switch - like in GNU/Linux - and I needed one badly. Having improved over it in [isUp.bat](https://github.com/C0d3rZ3r0/RandomScripts/blob/master/WindowsBatch/isUp.bat), I don't need it anymore, and I've kept it only for historical reasons. Finally, [dnsTest.bat](https://github.com/C0d3rZ3r0/RandomScripts/blob/master/WindowsBatch/dnsTest.bat) is what happens when you're as lazy as I'm.
